# code-quiz
This quiz application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It emphasizes Javascript to give the user questions
one at a time.  There are 5 questions with a timer of 60 seconds.  If you get a question right, the answer turns 
green.  If you answer incorrectly the answer turns red.  When time is up, you are alerted with an alert.  I am
still working on getting time deducted when getting an answer wrong.
